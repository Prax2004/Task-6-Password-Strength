## Passwords Tested and Results

| Password | Complexity Used | Strength Level | Feedback |
|--------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| password123 | lowercase + numbers | Weak | Very common and predictable, easily cracked |
| Password123 | uppercase + lowercase + numbers | Medium | Slightly stronger but still predictable |
| Pass@123 | uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbol | Medium | Short length reduces security |
| P@ssw0rd!2024 | uppercase + lowercase + numbers + symbols | Strong | Good complexity but contains common patterns |
| 9#Kp!ZrT2@XqL | random characters, long length | Very Strong | Highly secure and difficult to crack |

---

## Observations
- Longer passwords are significantly stronger
- Using a mix of characters increases password strength
- Random passwords perform better than meaningful words
- Common words reduce overall security even with symbols

---

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords
- Use at least 12–16 characters
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common words, names, and dates
- Do not reuse passwords
- Use random character combinations
- Use a password manager if possible

## Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
A brute force attack tries all possible combinations until the correct password is found. Strong and long passwords make this attack impractical.

### Dictionary Attack
A dictionary attack uses a list of common passwords and words. Passwords that contain dictionary words are vulnerable to this attack.

---

## Impact of Password Complexity on Security
Increasing password length and complexity increases the number of possible combinations, making it harder and more time-consuming for attackers to crack passwords.

---

## Conclusion
This task helped in understanding the importance of password security. Testing passwords using online tools clearly shows how complexity and randomness improve protection against brute force and dictionary attacks.
